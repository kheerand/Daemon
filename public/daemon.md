[ABOUT]

My name is Kheeran Dharmawardena and I am the Principal consultant at Cytrax Consulting, a small consulting firm that specialises in Complex Systems and information ecosystems.

I spend most of my time thinking about how the interconnected world works and how to architecture influences the behaviours of this complex system.

I am married to Jinani (Jini) Dharmawardena and have two children, Ethan and Anaya.

My main projects right now are building Cytrax business and brand, introducing dataspaces to Australia.

[MISSION]

Improve the human condition

[TELOS]

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured way to document Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, Goals to achieve, and Metrics to track progress. The name comes from the Greek word for purpose or end goal.

Problems (P) - The most important issues I see in the world that need solving:
- P1: Everything is complex in today's hyperconnected world, yet the predominant thinking and tools are ones catering for a complicated world.
- P2: People have poor models for how the world works, and the lack the tools to properly improve them

Missions (M) - My approaches to addressing these problems:
- M1: Increase the understanding and use of complex methodologies to problems.
- M2: Create social architectures that increase the coherence within the system to be strategic.
